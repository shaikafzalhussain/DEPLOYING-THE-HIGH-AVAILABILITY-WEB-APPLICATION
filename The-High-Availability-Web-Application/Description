-------------------------------- Project Description:  -------------------------------- 


The architecture diagram illustrates a multi-tier web application deployed on AWS. It consists of two VPCs (Primary and Secondary) for redundancy and high availability.The diagram depicts a high-availability web application architecture on AWS in the Singapore region. It utilizes multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for redundancy and VPC Peering for communication between different VPCs.



 Key Components: 

VPC Peering: Connects two VPCs (PRIVATE-SINGAPORE-1C and PUBLIC-SINGAPORE-1A) for communication between resources in different VPCs.

Public Subnets: Located in PUBLIC-SINGAPORE-1A and PUBLIC-SINGAPORE-1B, these subnets are accessible from the internet.

Private Subnets: Found in PRIVATE-SINGAPORE-1C, these subnets are isolated from the internet.

NAT Gateway: Enables instances in private subnets to access the internet for outbound traffic.

Load Balancers: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.

EC2 Instances: Compute resources running the web application.

Database Server: Stores the application's data.

Security Groups: Control inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances.

Route Tables: Determine how traffic is routed within the VPC.

Bastion Host: A jump server for secure SSH access to instances in the private subnet.

VPC Flow Logs: Captures information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces.

IAM Roles: Manage access permissions for AWS resources.

EFS: Provides shared file storage accessible to multiple instances.
